Arriving at this part of the programming assignment is difficult as previous code which I have written is difficult to combine. I did not create the previous parts in a way that will go together easy so I will have to re-write much of it. I think better planning would have allowed me to do this more easily, however also some of the programming assignments seen inherently interconnected and differentiating what needs to ought to remain seperate from other parts is difficult. For example PA 1 and PA 2 seemed fairly intertwined. Almost as if they could have been done in the same action. And PA 2, PA3, and PA 4 also seem to be fairly similar, as in a lot of the same parts are necessary for each. So finding a way to have them seperate but also easily combinable as been difficult. I created the QueryMapper class to have 3 main parts. "splitStringToWords" takes a String and returns it as a String array of the words within it. Then wordMatcher takes two String arrays and returns the percentage match of the two. Then determineQuery is intended to take the users query as a String, it will split the users query into words. It also takes a String array of all known queries and for each known possible query, it will split it into a String array of words and then the users string array and query string array can be given to the wordMatcher class which returns the percent match. This is done for each possible query and only the one with 70% or greater match will be chosen as the query. The intention behind using a string array for known queries is that it can later be imporved and the queries can be loaded in from a file. That way I could just implement something to load them and then if we wanted to expand possible known queries we could just add them to that file.
